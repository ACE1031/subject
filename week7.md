# [Week 7 prac 06]

# [Learning Activities]

# this weeks practical was to set up our group. I set up our trello page and github classroom repository and added these links into our group slack channel for everyone to access and for our lecturer to see and track. also linked them to slack to be able to be notified when taks are being done in these programs.
# i also filled out the Group Agreement & Contacts section of trello with my information and collaborated with the group to decide a set day and time that we would meet virtually on a livechat and discuss and assign tasks for the project.
# we also had a meeting to discuss and organise how we are setting up our hosting and development environments

# [Resources/Links]

# github
# lecture slides and prac outlines to setup collaborative workspaces
# [Estimated Hours]

# [Content Insights]

# this week was about project development, so getting our group together and organising resources to collaborate effectively, as well as how we assign tasks, and deal with any issues within the group. pretty much how to function as an effective group with these industry and professional methods 

# [Career/Employability/Learning Insights]

# by having a stand up meeting every week, it helps ensure people are on the right track and it is good practrise to get in as most industries use this. at my work currently in sales we have a 15min morning meeting disucssing key points of the day and debrief meeting at the end of the day to debrief and discuss any positives and or negatives of the day.
