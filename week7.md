# this weeks practical was to set up our group. I set up our trello page and github classroom repository and added these links into our gruop slack channel for everyone to access and for our lecturer to see and track.
# i also filled out the Group Agreement & Contacts section of trello with my information and collaborated with the group to decide a set day and time that we would meet virtually on a livechat and discuss and assign tasks for the project.
# we also had a meeting to discuss and organise how we are setting up our hosting and development environments
