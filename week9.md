# [Week 9 prac 08]

# [Learning Activities]
# This week we are tasked with creating a learning experiment. 

# The experiment is to first research what styles work on successful websites. This might be colour, placement, or ease of use/flow. 

# Once I’ve found styles that are on successful sites I then see if I can see how they are set up and start designing them on my current project.

# Once I’ve implemented the style, I want I start collaborating with the group and see if there are any refinements or changes necessary, and then continue to repeat this process.

# [Content Insights]
# Being that this week’s lectures are on CSS code, I’ve thought of a leaning experiment around testing and creating CSS code. For writing style CSS code, you need to have a goal in mind. So before writing the code, I decided to have a look at other successful business pages and see what sort of styles they’ve done with their menu bars, and how their page is laid out. The website I used was JCU’s main website for applying to be a student. Once I found what I liked, in this case the sticky menu bar at the top, I launched the inspect menu and found how that code was being used, then applied it to the group project and collaborated with my group to see if they liked it too or if there were better ways to implement this style. Then repeating this process with different sections of the website until we’ve created a theme file for the website that makes the website meets and exceeds the target audiences visual expectations
# [Career/Employability/Learning Insights]
# By being able to set up a methodical process of research and testing styles (CSS) this will allow me to help clients always stay up to date on current website styles and prevent my clients websites to become tacky ort outdated to the point that they start losing traffic and ultimately business.
