# [Content Insights]
# PHP files are used in creating website templates.
# Learnt how to implement: Echos, Decision statements, repetition statements, functions and include statements into PHP template code for a website theme. Most of this knowledge has been learnt in previous coding subjects so I knew most of the pseudocode for how to implement it. I learnt how to actually implement it in a website environment which was interesting to see how to call on different attributes and where to find the names of different attributes in the inspect menu

# [Career/Employability/Learning Insights]
# PHP code is used in creating template themes for websites such as WordPress for customers that don’t want to or don’t have the knowledge to create a theme style themselves. By having this knowledge, I can potentially make money creating themes for people to maintain and develop their own website with my theme template as their way of styling their own website.
