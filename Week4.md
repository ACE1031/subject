# Learning how to create a website locally and deploy remotely. 
# There is 3 steps in an ideal development process: local development, staging environment, and production/final website.
# local development:
# -	Its beneficial to use a local development environment like a virtual OS on your pc to develop new content and changes and make sure it works before uploading. This means changes can be made without the need for internet.
# staging environment:
# -	A staging environment is good to have to allow others such as clients and other colleagues working developing a website be able view and share opinions about the website before it gets published onto the official domain URL. With a client its good to ensure you are creating what they want and approve of before the site goes live, and if needed the client can provide a list of changes they want.
# production/final website:
# -	This is the final product. Its good to have this separate from the development area so that you cant break the existing website and all changes and updates can be approved prior to uploading to final website.
