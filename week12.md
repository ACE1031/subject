# This is the last week of the semester for the subject, so I decided to do a bit of reflection of the subject and what I learnt. We were also given a link to jcuâ€™s employability edge to investigate our career opportunities as this is a 3rd year subject designed to set us up for a career in IT.

# [Career/Employability/Learning Insights]
# Throughout this subject we have learnt to work independently to learn about Content Management Systems and learnt to develop skills without the help or assistance of the lecturer to develop and enhance our knowledge and skills picked up throughout the course of the degree in programming, website design, and project management. We have also learnt to work as part of a team with little to no guidance and have been able to produce a website for a client with clear instructions for the client so that they can continue to manage the content on the website themselves.
