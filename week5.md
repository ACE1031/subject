# [Week 5 prac 04]

# [Learning Activities]

# this week i created a local dev environment with virtual box and vagrant. i managed to install and run both these programs and even installed git bash to run vagrant through the terminal, but could not figure out how to install wordpress on vargrant. i tried using the lecture videos and extra content and did not help at all, so instead i scoured the internet for tutorials and after hours came across one video that made it so simple, (because it was a file that had it all set up already). this setup allowed me to run a default wordpress website (proof of concept, content at this point is irrelevant) locally on an ip address and still have access to the back end admin section to make changes as i desire and save any changes locally on my pc.

# [Content Insights]

# Learning how to create a website locally and deploy remotely. 

# There is 3 steps in an ideal development process: local development, staging environment, and production/final website.

# local development:

# - Its beneficial to use a local development environment like a virtual OS on your pc to develop new content and changes and make sure it works before uploading. This means changes can be made without the need for internet.

# staging environment:

# - A staging environment is good to have to allow others such as clients and other colleagues working developing a website be able view and share opinions about the website before it gets published onto the official domain URL. With a client its good to ensure you are creating what they want and approve of before the site goes live, and if needed the client can provide a list of changes they want.

# production/final website:

# - This is the final product. Its good to have this separate from the development area so that you cant break the existing website and all changes and updates can be approved prior to uploading to final website.

# [Career/Employability/Learning Insights]

# the skill of being able to create and develop within a virtual environment allows me to design and make changes to an established website without having to be connected to the internet and without overrighting the existing site with changes unless they are approved by the client first. this also allows me to be able to ensure there is no bugs or errors before uploading the final product and potentially crashing the clients existing site
