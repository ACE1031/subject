# [Week 6 prac 05]

# [Learning Activities]

# This week in the practicals i had to create a child theme and make style changes to a website through css style code and save these changes in a child theme file so anyone can download and use my child theme.
# i used the inspector element on the google chrome web browser on my chosen website to edit and make changes to text colour, padding, background colour, and font size in different element sections on the website. once i made a change that i was happy with (i made bold and large changes that i probably woultnt keep, just for the purpose to see exactly which element i changed), and was clearly noticable which part of the site i was editing, i copied this change and added it into my css file in my child theme folder.

# [Content Insights]
# additional css lets us make small changes to css code.(theme) Downside is any updates to the main theme will overright any changes youve added.

# learnt how to make changes in the browser for the style css code and test different changes then copy the changes into the child theme once happy. this allows me to visualise any changes i make before commiting them to the main theme, and also figure out what section i need to add the change to.

# learnt about template files. they are essentially reusable files that structure a site layout. i learnt that you can copy these template files into your child theme and wordpress will look for these template files in the child theme before going to the parent theme, so you can make changes to the template without permanently changing the theme files. downside is any updates to the parent theme wont update the child theme

# [Career/Employability/Learning Insights]
# having the knowledge to make child themes allows you to customise layouts of an exitsing website to give it a new look, which for a client, may be just what they need to get some more web traffic. they may know what content they want but may want it layed out if a different way that a template doesnt look, or possilby even want aspects from one template and some aspects from another, so a child theme can create exactly what they want.

# being able to analyse style code on any website allows clients to identify what style they like potentially on another existing site, and be able to use aspects to develop their website. also allows me to play with changes without affecting the website until im happy/ clients happy
