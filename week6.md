# [Content Insights]
# additional css lets us make small changes to css code.(theme) Downside is any updates to the main theme will overright any changes youve added.

# learnt how to make changes in the browser for the style css code and test different changes then copy the changes into the child theme once happy. this allows me to visualise any changes i make before commiting them to the main theme, and also figure out what section i need to add the change to.

# learnt about template files. they are essentially reusable files that structure a site layout. i learnt that you can copy these template files into your child theme and wordpress will look for these template files in the child theme before going to the parent theme, so you can make changes to the template without permanently changing the theme files. downside is any updates to the parent theme wont update the child theme

# [Career/Employability/Learning Insights]
# having the knowledge to make child themes allows you to customise layouts of an exitsing website to give it a new look, which for a client, may be just what they need to get some more web traffic. they may know what content they want but may want it layed out if a different way that a template doesnt look, or possilby even want aspects from one template and some aspects from another, so a child theme can create exactly what they want.

# being able to analyse style code on any website allows clients to identify what style they like potentially on another existing site, and be able to use aspects to develop their website. also allows me to play with changes without affecting the website until im happy/ clients happy
