# Learnt about WordPress this week, with a demo on how to use different features. We went over how to use WordPress to create and edit custom layouts and themes, add images, links(URLs) and content to a CMS site and what the different methods of uploading a site are. The two main methods being public so everyone can see straight away and private so that the client/developer can see and confirm changes before making things public.
# Learnt how to add navigation menus to link all the webpages together. Went over how to edit and change different aspects of templated themes to change appearance of website and suit clients needs. This can also be used to create a theme template from scratch.
# Most of this week was based around themes and plugins.

# [Career/Employability/Learning Insights]
# Over half of websites are WordPress websites. By having knowledge on how to use WordPress to create websites will greatly help my chances of getting into an industry that makes and maintains websites. There is also career opportunities in designing theme templates and plugins for other website builders to use. For people who donâ€™t want to go through the effort of designing or coding a theme to suit their content they just purchase a fully designed template that has blank spots for content.
