# We learnt about dynamic and static websites (with and without CMS). Dynamic systems are the better way of setting up a website because all of your information is stored on a server and you can update the server without having to download the entire website and make changes every time. Static websites are still ok but require a lot of manual editing every time an update is required.
# We went over briefly about what is required to create a dynamic website from scratch (lines of code to download and connect to a database, PHP files to keep themesâ€¦ etc). this is why site builders (CMS), like WordPress and Joomla are preferred when creating websites as they have all these functions available. 
# [Career/Employability/Learning Insights]
# This weeks prac helps get an overview of what building a website is like with all the little detail you have to keep in mind. In the later weeks when we work on CMS and databases it will help create skills, I can use in the workforce creating and maintaining websites for clients.
